                        and our core value is honesty, meaning that our product is genuine and of the highest quality. However, there have been misunderstandings and a lack of knowledge surrounding glass coatings, which we believe may be due to construction errors. We are eager to collaborate with you and share our knowledge and technology, as well as sell our product.

                        <br>Our shop is located in Niigata, a charming town in northern Japan that faces severe weather conditions. During the winter months from December to March, heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures are common, while the town experiences a rainy season from May to July, resulting in high levels of moisture.
                        
                        <br>Our product is made in Japan and has undergone extensive testing to ensure its quality. We are thrilled to introduce our product to a global audience and invite you to try it.
                        
                        <br>To enhance the visibility and appeal of our product to potential customers worldwide, we are currently developing a website that will highlight its unique features and benefits. We will provide high-quality images and comprehensive information on how to purchase our product.

                            Japanese culture values the representation of emotions and desires through Kanji, which conveys a powerful force associated with the thing. "SEI" refers to "bright and honorably shining thing," whereas the opposite, "lies and deceit without Sama," is considered dishonorable. The glass coating product offered by SEI is called Akira, which represents such a powerful force.

                            <br><br>Akira glass coating offers several features, such as forming a strong and flexible film that is strongly linked to the painted surface due to its small molecular size. It is highly resistant to corrosion caused by acidic substances and has excellent antifouling properties, making it difficult for deposits to accumulate on the surface. It also provides protection against ultraviolet light, heat, oil, water, chemicals, and impact, thus safeguarding the paint. The curing speed is optimized for better workability, resulting in low failure rates and a faster curing time. The solvent used in the coating is alcohol-based, making it environmentally friendly and safe for both the body and the paint.

                            The use of a strong solvent in glass coating to create a 9H-based hard coating results in poor performance and can cause damage to the paint. 
                            Moreover, it is harmful to human health and the environment, which limits its potential for future use. Basic glass coatings like conventional quartz have good workability, 
                            but they may result in deposits and soft coatings. 
                            However, SEI glass coating is designed to provide sufficient hardness and flexibility while being environmentally friendly and safe for humans. 
                            It is produced in Japan and is of high quality and stability, with proven results in hundreds of constructions. 
                            SEI glass coating is the next generation of coatings that considers strength, stain resistance, workability, and the environment. 
                            It represents a significant opportunity to increase customer satisfaction and build trust with construction shops. 
                            Knowing about this new technology will significantly change the car coating environment in the future.

                            Special skills and knowledge are not required to apply the next generation of glass coating. However, it is crucial to perform the application with care. 
                            This involves carefully washing the car, polishing and degreasing it, and accurately applying and wiping off the coating. 
                            Each step must be carried out meticulously to achieve good results. 
                            If there are any mistakes during the application, they can be rectified by wiping the coating off with alcohol such as IPA before it dries and cures.

                            1. The only potential cause of failure during the construction step is if wiping is not completed properly. However, if wiping is finished without leaving any marks, the construction process will not fail.
                            <br>2. Although it is possible to coat resin and plated parts, leveling is more difficult compared to paint. Therefore, during the construction process, it is essential to ensure that there are no irregularities. By doing so, it is possible to achieve a good finish and complete the wiping process slightly earlier.
                            <br>3. If wiping fails and the coating is not completely cured, it can be removed with alcohol. However, if the coating has already cured, the polishing process must be repeated. Complete curing takes around 7 days, but after 1-2 days, a mild abrasive can be used to remove the coating.

                            SEI has also focused on the daily car wash by ensuring that no special chemicals are required. 
                            Regular care involving mixing tepid car shampoo is enough to maintain its hydrophobic performance for an extended period. 
                            Despite the fact that the construction process is easy, it still requires attention to detail. 
                            However, it has the effect of increasing customer satisfaction by delivering a high-quality finish. 
                            The advanced glass coating is not only environmentally friendly but also produces an excellent finish, which is desirable for both car owners and builders. 
                            The quality of the finish after construction is the biggest priority for car owners, and this coating can maintain its beauty for a long period. 
                            Many customers in Japan have already been pleased with the results of this coating.
